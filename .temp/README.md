# Temporary Workspace

This directory is for temporary work-in-progress documents, notes, and scratch files.

**Usage:**

- AI assistant can create temporary summaries, analysis docs, etc. here
- All files in this directory are gitignored
- Clean up when done, but no pressure - it's ephemeral by design

**Examples:**

- Review summaries during multi-step work
- Intermediate analysis results
- Scratch benchmarks
- Planning documents

This is NOT for:

- Anything that should be committed
- Research findings (use `docs/active/experiments/`)
- Archive material (use `archive/`)
