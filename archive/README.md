# Archive

The code for archived implementations has been removed, but documentation and git history preserve everything. This keeps the repository maintainable while preserving the research record.

## What's Archived

**7 superseded implementations** - Worked but were replaced by better alternatives (e.g., HilbertLinearScan â†’ MortonLinearScan was 25% faster)

**2 failed experiments** - Didn't work at all (e.g., HybridRTree had 1.9-27x overhead from indirection)

**4 analysis docs** - Early findings later refined in main documentation

See [IMPLEMENTATION-HISTORY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-HISTORY.md) for the complete table with performance numbers and git SHAs.

## Why This Matters

Three implementations seemed reasonable but failed spectacularly:

1. **HybridRTree** (1.9-27x slower) - Tried to adaptively switch between linear scan and R-tree. Indirection overhead killed it.

2. **Fast R-tree** (1.29x slower) - Used R* axis selection with midpoint splits to get quality cheaply. Axis selection cost more than it saved.

3. **CompactRTree** - Couldn't handle dynamic splits with TypedArrays. Fundamentally incompatible with how R-trees work.

If you're thinking "what if we combine X and Y?" or "what if we optimize Z?", check here first. Chances are it's been tried.

## Getting Archived Code

Each entry in IMPLEMENTATION-HISTORY.md has a git SHA. Use it to retrieve the code:

```bash
# View the implementation
git show 454e5c9:archive/src/implementations/hilbertlinearscan.ts

# Run benchmarks from that point
git checkout 454e5c9 -- archive/
deno bench archive/benchmarks/
git restore archive/  # Clean up
```

The code is fully runnable from git history - tests, benchmarks, everything.

## What to Read

**Quick lookup**: [IMPLEMENTATION-HISTORY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-HISTORY.md) has a one-line summary of each archived implementation

**Experiment details**: [docs/RESEARCH-ARCHIVE-SUMMARY.md](./docs/RESEARCH-ARCHIVE-SUMMARY.md) explains what was tried and why it failed

**Current state**: `../docs/core/RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md` documents validated findings and active implementations
