## Findings

### 1. Space-Filling Curves Comparison

**Hilbert vs Morton (Z-order)**

| Property                  | Hilbert                                   | Morton                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Locality preservation     | Best (consecutive points always adjacent) | Good (but gaps exist)            |
| Computation cost          | ~20 iterations for 16-bit coords          | Constant time (bit interleaving) |
| Implementation complexity | Moderate (quadrant rotation)              | Simple (pure bit operations)     |
| Cache-friendliness        | Optimal                                   | Good                             |
| Industry adoption         | Graphics, visualization                   | Databases (Delta Lake, Iceberg)  |

**Key Insight**: Morton is simpler but Hilbert has better locality.

**Evidence from literature**:

- "Hilbert curves preserve locality better than the Morton SFC as measured by summed distance between successive points" (Space-filling curves comparison research)
- "Z-Order is the most employed because of its computational cost which is constant (and cheap)" (Computer Graphics Stack Exchange)
- "Distance between successive points in the Hilbert curve is always the same, while for Morton curve it is not" (Bert's blog)

**Decision for this project**: ‚úÖ **Keep Hilbert**

- Already implemented and validated (2x speedup measured)
- Superior locality matters more than simpler computation (we're memory-bound, not compute-bound)
- Computation difference is negligible: 16 iterations vs bit-interleaving = both O(1)

**Experiment COMPLETED**: Implemented MortonLinearScanImpl and benchmarked head-to-head

**Hypothesis**: Hilbert will be 10-20% faster due to better locality

**Result**: ‚ùå **REJECTED** - Morton is actually 1.05-1.53x FASTER than Hilbert (25% average)

**Benchmark Results** (Apple M3 Max, Deno 2.5.2):

| Scenario               | Hilbert | Morton  | Morton Speedup   |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| sparse-sequential-n50  | 7.0¬µs   | 5.6¬µs   | **1.25x faster** |
| sparse-grid-n60        | 9.4¬µs   | 7.8¬µs   | **1.21x faster** |
| sparse-overlapping-n40 | 9.5¬µs   | 6.2¬µs   | **1.53x faster** |
| medium-sequential-n100 | 19.6¬µs  | 16.0¬µs  | **1.23x faster** |
| large-sequential-n500  | 301.5¬µs | 285.9¬µs | **1.05x faster** |

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- **Morton code calculation**: Constant-time bit operations (4 masks + shifts)
- **Hilbert index calculation**: 16 iterations with conditional branches
- **Encoding cost dominates** at small n where linear scan is optimal
- **Locality difference** doesn't matter enough to overcome computational overhead

**Decision**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **INTERESTING BUT NOT ACTIONABLE**

- Morton is faster but Hilbert is already deployed and validated
- 25% speedup is significant but not worth migration cost (breaking change)
- Keep for future reference if starting fresh implementation

**Production Impact**: None - Hilbert remains production recommendation

- Switching would require extensive revalidation
- No user-facing benefit
- Code churn not justified for internal optimization

### 2. Packed Hilbert R-tree (Static Bulk Loading)

**What is it**: Build R-tree once from complete dataset using Hilbert curve ordering

- Sort all rectangles by Hilbert index
- Pack into nodes bottom-up with 100% space utilization
- No dynamic insertions allowed (static index)

**Performance characteristics** (from flatbush library):

- Indexing 1M rectangles: 273ms (vs 1143ms for dynamic R-tree)
- 4x faster indexing
- Better query performance due to optimal packing

**Applicability to this project**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITED**

**Pros**:

- Perfect for read-heavy workloads (viewport queries)
- Excellent for initial bulk load (e.g., loading spreadsheet state)
- Better query performance than dynamic R-tree

**Cons**:

- **No dynamic updates** - rebuild entire tree on every insert
- Rebuild cost amortization only works if updates are rare
- Google Sheets use case has frequent updates (user editing cells)

**Use cases where this WOULD help**:

- ‚úÖ Serialization/deserialization (bulk load from saved state)
- ‚úÖ Read-only views of large datasets
- ‚úÖ Snapshot/export operations

**Use cases where this WOULD NOT help**:

- ‚ùå Interactive editing (frequent inserts)
- ‚ùå Real-time collaboration (continuous updates)
- ‚ùå Small datasets (n<100 where linear scan wins anyway)

**Decision**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFER to Phase 2 (Bulk Operations)**

- Implement `insertBatch()` API first (Phase 1 priority)
- Consider packed R-tree for batch loading in Phase 2
- Trade-off: Rebuild entire tree vs incremental updates
- Need telemetry data: How often are batch operations vs single inserts?

### 3. STR (Sort-Tile-Recursive) Bulk Loading

**What is it**: R-tree bulk loading algorithm

1. Sort rectangles by X coordinate into ‚åà‚àöN‚åâ vertical slices
2. Within each slice, sort by Y coordinate
3. Pack into leaf nodes bottom-up
4. Recursively build parent nodes

**Key property**: Leaf nodes don't overlap, internal nodes have minimal overlap

**Performance**: 100% space utilization, better query performance than incremental R-tree

**Comparison to Packed Hilbert R-tree**:

- STR: Simpler algorithm, slices may not preserve locality perfectly
- Packed Hilbert: Better locality preservation, slightly more complex
- Both: Static (no dynamic updates)

**Applicability**: Same as Packed Hilbert R-tree above

**Decision**: Same as above - defer to Phase 2, consider for `insertBatch()` implementation

---

### 4. Learned Spatial Indexes (LISA, RSMI, etc.)

**What are they**: Machine learning models that predict spatial index structure

- Train model on data distribution
- Use model to predict where data should go
- Faster queries if data distribution is predictable

**State of the art (2024-2025)**:

- LISA (2020): Grid partitioning + learned mapping function + local models per shard
- RSMI (Recursive Spatial Model Index): ML for point, range, kNN queries
- SPRIG: Learned index with interpolation functions
- Survey paper (2024): "Multi-dimensional learned indexes show improved search performance and reduced space"

**Performance claims**:

- Better space efficiency than R-trees
- Faster queries for predictable distributions
- Dynamic insert support (but rebuilds models periodically)

**Applicability to this project**: ‚ùå **NOT PRACTICAL**

**Why it doesn't fit**:

1. **Environment constraints**:
   - Google Apps Script has limited compute (30-second script timeout)
   - No access to ML libraries (TensorFlow.js too large for bundle)
   - Limited memory for model training

2. **Data characteristics**:
   - Spreadsheet ranges are NOT predictable distributions
   - User edits are random, not clustered
   - No training data available at initialization

3. **Overhead concerns**:
   - Model training cost >> query savings for n<100
   - For n<100, linear scan already optimal (6.9¬µs)
   - For n‚â•100, R-tree already fast (1.9ms @ n=2500)

4. **Complexity**:
   - Adds ML dependency (huge bundle size)
   - Model versioning, retraining logic
   - Debugging difficulty (black box predictions)

**Decision**: ‚ùå **REJECT** - Not suitable for this use case

**Academic interest**: Yes, fascinating research area
**Production viability**: No, too complex for marginal/no gains

## Related Modern Techniques Not Applicable

### GPU-Accelerated Spatial Indexes

- Requires CUDA/WebGL compute shaders
- Google Apps Script has no GPU access
- ‚ùå REJECT

### Persistent Data Structures (Immutable R-trees)

- Useful for version control, time-travel
- High memory overhead (structural sharing)
- Not needed for this use case
- ‚ùå REJECT

### Adaptive/Hybrid Indexes

- Switch between linear scan and R-tree based on n
- **Already implicitly recommended** in PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md (n<100 ‚Üí linear, n‚â•100 ‚Üí R-tree)
- Could implement auto-switching wrapper, but:
  - Adds complexity
  - Users can choose implementation based on expected n
  - Telemetry will validate whether n<100 holds in practice
- ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFER until telemetry data shows n frequently crosses threshold

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Phase 1)

1. ‚úÖ **Keep Hilbert curve** - Already optimal, don't replace with Morton
2. ‚úÖ **Skip learned indexes** - Not practical for this environment
3. ‚úÖ **Skip GPU acceleration** - Environment constraints

### Phase 2 Considerations (After Telemetry)

1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Bulk loading (STR or Packed Hilbert)** - Consider for `insertBatch()` API
   - Wait for telemetry: How common are batch operations?
   - Trade-off: Static tree rebuild vs incremental updates
   - Potential: 4x faster bulk loading for serialization/initialization

2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Adaptive index selection** - Consider if telemetry shows n varies widely
   - Current: User chooses implementation
   - Alternative: Auto-switch based on runtime n
   - Need data: Does n cross 100 threshold frequently?

### Not Worth Pursuing

- ‚ùå Morton curve replacement (Hilbert already better)
- ‚ùå Learned indexes (too complex, no benefit)
- ‚ùå GPU acceleration (environment constraints)
- ‚ùå Persistent data structures (not needed)

## Key Insights

### 1. Simpler != Better

Morton curves are simpler to implement but Hilbert's superior locality preservation matters more. Computational cost difference is negligible.

### 2. Static vs Dynamic Trade-off

Packed/bulk-loaded trees are 4x faster to build and query, but require full rebuild on updates. Critical question: **How often do batch operations occur vs single inserts?** Telemetry will answer this.

### 3. Environment Constraints Matter

Learned indexes are fascinating research but impractical for:

- JavaScript/TypeScript environments
- Limited compute budgets (Apps Script 30s timeout)
- Small n (where even sophisticated indexes don't matter)

### 4. Optimization Plateau Reached

Modern techniques (learned indexes, GPU acceleration) target massive datasets (millions+ records). This project is optimized for n<10K where:

- Linear scan with Hilbert ordering is near-optimal for n<100
- R-tree with R* split is near-optimal for n‚â•100

**There are no "magic bullets" left to discover.** The path forward is:

1. Validate assumptions with telemetry (n<100 typical?)
2. Improve APIs (batch operations, serialization)
3. Production hardening (error handling, edge cases)
