# Optimization Feasibility Study (2025-10-07)

**Historical Note**: This analysis examined HilbertLinearScanImpl (now superseded by MortonLinearScanImpl, which is 25% faster). The findings about optimization opportunities and test coverage improvements remain valid.

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis of all 3 active implementations for optimization opportunities across performance, bundle size, and test coverage. **Key finding**: Current implementations are near-optimal for their respective algorithms. Test coverage successfully improved with 4 new axioms, but performance optimizations do not meet the >10% improvement threshold.

## Scope

**Implementations analyzed**:

- HilbertLinearScanImpl (238 lines, ~1.8KB minified)
- RStarTreeImpl (785 lines, ~8.4KB minified)
- CompactLinearScanImpl (73 lines, ~1.2KB minified)

**Optimization dimensions**:

1. Performance (execution speed)
2. Bundle size (code size)
3. Test coverage (edge cases)

## Test Coverage (VALIDATED)

### Results

**Added 4 new conformance test axioms** (17 total, up from 13):

1. Boundary conditions (single-cell, single-row/column, coordinate zero)
2. Query edge cases (empty, infinite, exact match, partial overlap)
3. Value reachability invariant (all values queryable)
4. Coordinate extremes (large coordinates, mixed scales)

**Test count**: 51 tests (up from 43)
**Status**: ✓ All implementations pass with no regressions

**Impact**: High - Explicit coverage of edge cases previously implicit

See `docs/analyses/test-coverage-improvements.md` for details.

## Performance Analysis

### HilbertLinearScanImpl

**Current Performance**: Fastest in 21/35 benchmark scenarios (n<100)

**Analysis**:

```typescript
// Key operations:
hilbertIndex(); // O(16) iterations, pure function
insert(); // O(n) scan + O(n) splice per fragment
binarySearch(); // O(log n) for Hilbert-sorted array
subtract(); // O(1) geometric decomposition
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:

| Optimization                  | Expected Gain     | Complexity | Recommended |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Cache Hilbert indices         | <1%               | Medium     | No          |
| Optimize subtract filter      | 2-3%              | Low        | No          |
| Preallocate overlapping array | <1%               | Low        | No          |
| Inline center calculations    | 0% (already done) | N/A        | N/A         |

**Verdict**: NOT RECOMMENDED

- Already near-optimal for algorithm
- 2x speedup came from Hilbert curve ordering (already implemented)
- Marginal gains (<5%) not worth complexity
- Further improvements require algorithmic change (e.g., Morton curve)

### RStarTreeImpl

**Current Performance**: Fastest in 12/35 scenarios (n>100), best for large data

**Analysis**:

```typescript
// Key operations:
insertIntoNode(); // O(log n) tree traversal
splitNode(); // O(m²) bbox recomputation [INEFFICIENCY]
updateBounds(); // O(m) per node
searchEntries(); // O(log n) with spatial pruning
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:

| Optimization                      | Expected Gain     | Complexity | Recommended |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Optimize split bbox recomputation | 5-10% on splits   | Medium     | Maybe       |
| Preallocate node/entry capacity   | 3-5% construction | Low        | Maybe       |
| Pool TypedArray allocations       | 2-4%              | Medium     | No          |
| Optimize expansion calculation    | <1%               | Low        | No          |

**Detailed Analysis of Split Optimization**:

- **Current**: Lines 636-652 recompute group2 bbox on every iteration
- **Inefficiency**: O(m²) where m = children count (typically 10)
- **Frequency**: Only during splits (~1 per 10 inserts in balanced tree)
- **Overall impact**: 2-5% on large workloads (n>1000)

**Verdict**: BORDERLINE

- Clear inefficiency exists in split algorithm
- But: Below 10% overall improvement threshold
- **Decision**: DEFER - not worth experiment overhead for <10% gain

### CompactLinearScanImpl

**Current Performance**: Slowest but smallest (1.2KB minified)

**Analysis**:

```typescript
// Optimized for size, not speed:
cut(); // Functional style, compact
hits(); // Inline AABB test
insert(); // Single-pass with inline operations
```

**Optimization Opportunities**: None

**Verdict**: NOT RECOMMENDED

- Purpose is minimal bundle size (achieved)
- Any optimization would increase code size
- Performance tradeoff is intentional

## Bundle Size Analysis

**Current sizes**:

- CompactLinearScanImpl: 73 lines → ~1.2KB minified ✓
- HilbertLinearScanImpl: 238 lines → ~1.8KB minified ✓
- RStarTreeImpl: 785 lines → ~8.4KB minified ✓

**Analysis**:

- All appropriately sized for their algorithmic complexity
- CompactLinearScanImpl already minimal
- HilbertLinearScanImpl needs Hilbert logic (necessary size)
- RStarTreeImpl has inherent tree structure complexity

**Verdict**: No optimization opportunities

## Decision Matrix

| Implementation    | Performance Opt   | Bundle Size Opt | Recommended Action |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| HilbertLinearScan | <5% gain          | No opportunity  | None               |
| R*-tree           | 2-5% gain         | No opportunity  | Defer              |
| CompactLinearScan | N/A (intentional) | No opportunity  | None               |

## Key Insights

1. **Algorithmic Dominance**
   - Current performance characteristics are algorithmically determined
   - HilbertLinearScan: O(n) with 2x constant factor from spatial locality
   - R*-tree: O(log n) with overhead from tree maintenance
   - Micro-optimizations cannot overcome algorithmic complexity

2. **Implementation Maturity**
   - HilbertLinearScan: Near-optimal for linear scan + Hilbert ordering
   - R*-tree: Well-implemented R* algorithm with minor inefficiency in split
   - CompactLinearScan: Achieves minimal size goal

3. **Optimization Threshold**
   - Project standard: >10% improvement with CV% <5%
   - R*-tree split optimization: 2-5% (below threshold)
   - HilbertLinearScan optimizations: <5% (well below threshold)

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Each implementation serves its niche:
     - HilbertLinearScan: Fast for n<100 ✓
     - R*-tree: Fast for n>100 ✓
     - CompactLinearScan: Smallest bundle ✓

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✓ **Test coverage improvements** - COMPLETED (4 new axioms)
2. **No performance optimizations** - None meet >10% threshold

### Future Research Directions

1. **Algorithmic variants**:
   - Morton curve vs Hilbert (simpler bit operations)
   - Adaptive switching (linear → tree at threshold)
   - Hybrid structures (spatial locality + tree pruning)

2. **Domain-specific optimizations**:
   - Column/row-optimized for spreadsheet patterns
   - Striping-aware implementations
   - Merge-like block specializations

3. **API improvements** (higher impact than micro-optimizations):
   - Batch insertion API
   - Serialization/deserialization
   - Iterator patterns for large result sets

### Not Recommended

- Micro-optimizations to existing implementations (<10% gain)
- Bundle size reductions (already minimal for complexity)
- Memoization/caching (rare repeated calls)

## Validation Criteria

**For future optimization attempts, require**:

- [ ] 10% performance improvement
- [ ] CV% <5% (stable measurements)
- [ ] No regression on other workloads
- [ ] All 51 tests pass
- [ ] Code size increase <10%

**This study did not identify any optimizations meeting these criteria.**

## Conclusion

**Test Coverage**: ✓ IMPROVED (4 new axioms, 51 tests total)

**Performance**: ✗ NO VIABLE OPTIMIZATIONS

- HilbertLinearScan: <5% gains possible (not worth effort)
- R*-tree: 2-5% gains possible (below 10% threshold)
- CompactLinearScan: Intentionally size-optimized (no changes)

**Bundle Size**: ✓ ALREADY OPTIMAL (no opportunities)

**Overall Assessment**: Current implementations are production-ready and well-optimized for their respective algorithms. Focus should shift to:

1. New algorithm research (Morton curve, hybrid approaches)
2. API ergonomics and developer experience
3. Documentation and examples
4. Real-world performance monitoring

**No experimental implementations needed at this time.**
