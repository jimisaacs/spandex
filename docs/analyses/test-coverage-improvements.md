# Test Coverage Improvements (2025-10-07)

**⚠️ HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT**: This document describes test improvements from October 7, 2025.
Subsequent refactoring removed redundant tests while adding critical missing tests (query consistency,
Last-Writer-Wins ordering validation), resulting in the current production test suite of **117 tests**
(80 conformance + 17 partitioned + 8 telemetry + 6 adversarial + 2 integration + 4 adapters).
See `src/conformance/testsuite.ts` and `test/` directory for current state.

**Note**: This document references `getAllRanges()` which was part of the API at the time but has since
been unified into `query()` (with no arguments for all ranges).

---

## Summary

Added 4 new conformance test axioms to the test suite, increasing coverage from 13 to 17 axioms (51 total tests including per-implementation tests). All edge cases now explicitly tested.

## Motivation

The conformance test suite (src/conformance/testsuite.ts) had good coverage of core LWW semantics, overlap resolution, and fragmentation, but lacked explicit tests for:

- Boundary conditions (single-cell, single-row/column, coordinate zero)
- Query-specific edge cases (empty index, infinite query, exact match)
- Value reachability across query methods
- Coordinate extremes and mixed scales

## Changes

### New Test Axioms

**1. Boundary Conditions** (lines 313-342)

- Single-cell range (1x1)
- Single-row range (height=1, width>1)
- Single-column range (height>1, width=1)
- Range at coordinate 0
- Verifies all values remain reachable

**2. Query Edge Cases** (lines 344-377)

- Query on empty index returns empty array
- Query with infinite range returns all entries
- Query exact match (query === stored range)
- Query partial overlap (multiple ranges)
- Query no overlap returns empty
- Verifies queries don't modify state

**3. Value Reachability Invariant** (lines 379-422)

- Inserts non-overlapping ranges (grid pattern)
- Verifies all values reachable via query()
- Verifies all values reachable via query() (no args)
- Verifies query(bounds) and query() return same values
- Tests that no values are lost (beyond LWW overwrites)

**4. Coordinate Extremes** (lines 424-439)

- Very large coordinates (1,000,000+)
- Query at large coordinates
- Mix of small and large coordinates
- Verifies no overflow or scaling issues

### Test Count

**Before**: 43 tests (13 axioms × 3 implementations + integration tests)
**After**: 51 tests (17 axioms × 3 implementations + integration tests)

## Results

### All Implementations Pass

- **MortonLinearScanImpl**: 21 tests (17 axioms + 4 implementation-specific) ✓
- **RStarTreeImpl**: 19 tests (17 axioms + 2 implementation-specific) ✓
- **Integration tests**: 3 tests ✓
- **Adversarial tests**: 6 tests ✓

**Total**: 46 tests passing (active implementations only)

**Historical note**: HilbertLinearScanImpl and CompactLinearScanImpl were archived after being superseded by MortonLinearScanImpl.

### Coverage Improvements

| Category            | Before   | After         | Improvement         |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Boundary conditions | Partial  | Explicit      | 4 test cases        |
| Query edge cases    | Basic    | Comprehensive | 5 test scenarios    |
| Value reachability  | Implicit | Explicit      | Invariant validated |
| Coordinate extremes | None     | Explicit      | 3 test scenarios    |

### Key Findings

1. **All implementations handle boundary conditions correctly**
   - Single-cell, single-row, single-column ranges work as expected
   - Coordinate zero properly handled

2. **Query behavior consistent across implementations**
   - Empty index queries work correctly
   - Infinite queries return all entries
   - Partial overlaps detected properly

3. **Value reachability verified**
   - Non-overlapping values always queryable
   - query(bounds) and query() return consistent results
   - No silent data loss beyond LWW semantics

4. **Coordinate scaling works correctly**
   - Large coordinates (1M+) handled properly
   - Mixed coordinate scales work together
   - No overflow issues in TypedArrays (R*-tree uses Int32Array)

## Impact

**Increased Confidence**: Edge cases now explicitly tested rather than implicitly covered
**Better Documentation**: Tests serve as specification for boundary behavior
**Regression Prevention**: Future changes will be validated against these cases
**No Performance Impact**: Tests run quickly, add <50ms to test suite

## Code Changes

**File**: `src/conformance/testsuite.ts`
**Lines Added**: ~65 lines
**Lines Modified**: 0 (purely additive)
**Breaking Changes**: None

## Lessons Learned

1. **Value reachability with LWW semantics**
   - Initial test failed because random ranges overlap, causing LWW overwrites
   - Fixed by using non-overlapping grid pattern
   - Teaches: LWW means some values may be overwritten (expected behavior)

2. **Coordinate extremes matter**
   - R*-tree uses TypedArrays (Int32Array) with 32-bit bounds
   - MortonLinearScan uses 16-bit Morton curve (MAX_COORD = 65536)
   - Tests verify both handle large coordinates correctly (within their bounds)

3. **Query consistency is testable**
   - query(bounds) and query() should return same value sets
   - This invariant was implicit, now explicit

## Future Improvements

**Potential additions** (lower priority):

- Error handling tests (invalid ranges, negative coordinates)
- Performance regression tests (prevent slowdowns)
- Memory leak tests (for long-running operations)
- Concurrency tests (if adding async support)

**Not recommended**:

- Zero-width ranges (already rejected by implementations)
- Null/undefined values (TypeScript prevents at compile time)
- Thread safety tests (single-threaded environment)

## Validation

**Status**: ✓ VALIDATED

All 3 active implementations pass the expanded test suite with no regressions. Coverage gaps successfully filled.
