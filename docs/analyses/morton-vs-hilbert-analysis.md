# Morton vs Hilbert Analysis: Simpler Encoding Wins at Small n

**Finding**: Morton curve (Z-order) is 5-53% faster than Hilbert curve for linear scan spatial indexing (25% average speedup)

**Impact**: Replaced HilbertLinearScanImpl with MortonLinearScanImpl as production recommendation for n<100

## Result

**Morton curve supersedes Hilbert curve** for small-scale spatial indexing

| Scenario               | Hilbert | Morton  | Morton Speedup | CV% |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- | --- |
| sparse-sequential-n50  | 7.0µs   | 5.6µs   | 1.25x faster   | <5% |
| sparse-grid-n60        | 9.4µs   | 7.8µs   | 1.21x faster   | <5% |
| sparse-overlapping-n40 | 9.5µs   | 6.2µs   | 1.53x faster   | <5% |
| medium-sequential-n100 | 19.6µs  | 16.0µs  | 1.23x faster   | <5% |
| large-sequential-n500  | 301.5µs | 285.9µs | 1.05x faster   | <5% |

**Average speedup**: 1.25x (25% faster)

**Statistical confidence**: All measurements stable (CV% <5%), effect sizes >10% represent large improvements

## Hypothesis

**Original assumption**: Hilbert curve would be faster due to superior spatial locality preservation

**Theory**:

- Hilbert curve has better locality properties (academic consensus)
- Better locality → better cache utilization → faster queries
- Worth the extra encoding cost

**Prediction**: Hilbert would maintain 2x advantage over naive linear scan and outperform Morton

## Methodology

### Implementation

Created `MortonLinearScanImpl` with identical structure to `HilbertLinearScanImpl`:

**Morton encoding** (constant-time bit interleaving):

```typescript
function mortonCode(x: number, y: number): number {
	x = x & 0xFFFF;
	y = y & 0xFFFF;

	// Spread bits using magic masks
	x = (x | (x << 8)) & 0x00FF00FF;
	x = (x | (x << 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F;
	x = (x | (x << 2)) & 0x33333333;
	x = (x | (x << 1)) & 0x55555555;

	y = (y | (y << 8)) & 0x00FF00FF;
	y = (y | (y << 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F;
	y = (y | (y << 2)) & 0x33333333;
	y = (y | (y << 1)) & 0x55555555;

	// Interleave: x in even positions, y in odd positions
	return x | (y << 1);
}
```

**Hilbert encoding** (16 iterations with branching):

```typescript
function hilbertIndex(x: number, y: number): number {
	let index = 0;
	for (let s = MAX_COORD / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
		const rx = (x & s) > 0 ? 1 : 0;
		const ry = (y & s) > 0 ? 1 : 0;
		index += s * s * ((3 * rx) ^ ry);

		// Rotate quadrant for continuity
		if (ry === 0) {
			if (rx === 1) {
				x = MAX_COORD - 1 - x;
				y = MAX_COORD - 1 - y;
			}
			[x, y] = [y, x]; // Swap
		}
	}
	return index;
}
```

### Testing

1. **Conformance**: All 17 axioms passing (same test suite)
2. **Adversarial**: Same fragmentation patterns (spatial ordering works)
3. **Head-to-head benchmark**: Direct comparison across 5 scenarios

### Measurement

- **Runs**: 5 runs per scenario
- **Deno sampling**: 50-100 iterations per run internally
- **Total iterations**: 250-500 per scenario
- **CV% threshold**: <5% for stable measurements
- **Effect size threshold**: >10% for meaningful differences
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes total for full statistical analysis (5 runs)

## Analysis

### Root Cause: Encoding Cost Dominates

**Key insight**: At small n (<100), encoding cost matters more than locality benefit

**Encoding cost comparison**:

| Curve   | Operations                  | Cost                             |
| ------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Morton  | 10 masks + shifts           | Constant time, branch-free       |
| Hilbert | 16 iterations with branches | Linear in bit depth, conditional |

**Morton advantages**:

1. **Branch-free**: No conditional logic in inner loop
2. **Parallel**: All bit operations can execute concurrently
3. **Simple**: Fewer operations overall
4. **Predictable**: No data-dependent branches

**Hilbert disadvantages**:

1. **Iterative**: 16 sequential iterations
2. **Branching**: Conditional rotation logic
3. **Data-dependent**: Branch prediction varies by input
4. **More arithmetic**: Multiplications and XORs per iteration

### Locality Analysis

**Theoretical**: Hilbert has better locality (true)

**Practical**: At n<100, locality difference doesn't matter enough

**Why**:

1. **Small dataset**: n=50 entries ≈ 400 bytes (fits in L1 cache)
2. **Sequential scan**: Already cache-friendly (hardware prefetcher works)
3. **Marginal benefit**: Going from "good locality" to "excellent locality" doesn't help when everything fits in cache

**Crossover hypothesis**: Hilbert might win at larger n (1000+) where locality matters more, but that's R-tree territory anyway

### Performance Breakdown

Estimated time per insert at n=50:

| Implementation | Total | Encoding | Scan  | Overlap | Insert |
| -------------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Morton         | 5.6µs | ~0.3µs   | 2.0µs | 2.0µs   | 1.3µs  |
| Hilbert        | 7.0µs | ~0.9µs   | 2.0µs | 2.0µs   | 1.1µs  |

**Difference**: Morton saves ~0.6µs per insert through faster encoding (0.9 - 0.3 = 0.6µs savings vs slight overhead elsewhere)

---

## Decision

### Why Replace Hilbert?

1. **Empirical evidence**: Morton is 25% faster on average
2. **Consistent advantage**: Faster across all 5 test scenarios
3. **Simpler code**: Easier to understand and maintain
4. **No downsides**: Same correctness, same spatial locality benefits
5. **No users**: This is research code, no deployment to migrate

### Addressing Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Initial reaction**: "Morton is interesting but not actionable"

**Rationalization**:

- "Hilbert is already deployed and validated"
- "Migration cost not worth 25% speedup"
- "Code churn not justified"

**Reality**:

- ❌ There are no deployed users
- ❌ This is research code
- ❌ Morton is objectively better
- ✅ Science says: accept surprising results

**Correct decision**: Replace Hilbert with Morton

### What We Keep from Hilbert Research

**Research value preserved**:

1. **Insight**: Space-filling curves provide spatial locality benefits
2. **Approach**: Sorting by curve index improves cache behavior
3. **Architecture**: Store index with entry, binary search for insertion
4. **Analysis**: Full documentation in `docs/analyses/hilbert-curve-analysis.md`

**What changes**:

- Production implementation uses Morton instead of Hilbert
- Same benefits, simpler encoding

## Key Lessons

### 1. Simpler Can Be Better

**Theory**: Hilbert has superior locality properties
**Practice**: Morton's simpler encoding wins at small scale

**Takeaway**: Theoretical advantages don't always translate to practical benefits at target scale

### 2. Encoding Cost Matters

**At small n**: Encoding cost dominates over locality benefits
**At large n**: Locality benefits dominate (but R-tree is better anyway)

**Takeaway**: Match algorithm complexity to problem scale

### 3. Accept Surprising Results

**Expected**: Hilbert would maintain 2x advantage from original research
**Found**: Morton is actually faster

**Takeaway**: Rigorous experimentation sometimes contradicts assumptions - accept and adapt

### 4. Research Value Persists

**Hilbert research wasn't wasted**:

- Proved space-filling curves work
- Established spatial locality principle
- Provided architecture for Morton
- Full analysis preserved in archive

**Takeaway**: Failed experiments still provide value

## Future Work

### Potential Investigations

1. **Larger n crossover**: Does Hilbert win at n=1000+?
   - Unlikely: R-tree already dominates at n>100
   - Academic interest only

2. **3D spatial indexing**: Does Hilbert advantage appear in 3D?
   - Out of scope for spreadsheet use case
   - Interesting for GIS/CAD applications

3. **Cache profiling**: Measure actual cache behavior
   - Would validate/refute locality hypothesis
   - Requires hardware counters (perf, VTune)

### No Action Needed

Current state is optimal for target use case (n<100 spreadsheet properties).
